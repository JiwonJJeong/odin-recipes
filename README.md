Odin Foundations Recipes Project

This is my first project made for The Odin Project. This website was written with HTML code to create a basic recipe website. I practiced the following skills to create this website!

- Navigate directories and create new directories and files with the command line
- Commit my local changes to git with meaningful comments
- Use GitHub to store my local changes online and share my work
- Combine headers, list, and paragraph elements to create simple pages
- Link different pages to my home page using relative paths
- Add images to pages
- Code for accessibility with image metadata
